# 🧮 Simple Python Calculator

This is a basic command-line calculator built using Python. It performs simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## 🚀 Features

- User-friendly command-line interface
- Supports:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Handles invalid operations with error messages

## 🛠️ How It Works

The program prompts the user to:

1. Enter the first number
2. Enter the second number
3. Choose an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)

Then, it calculates and displays the result.

## 🧾 Example

```bash
Enter first number: 10  
Enter second number: 5  
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): +  
Result: 10 + 5 = 15
